<h1 align="center"> <code> SupPy </code> </h1>

A little collection of standalone Python projects made for fun!


<br>


## Index

| project | description |
| :------ | :---------- |
| [`determinant.py`](determinant.py) | Recursively finding the determinant of a square matrix |
| [`walker.py`](walker.py) | Walking the worlds by distance |

## Notes

These are all personal projects, so they include my [unconventional Python syntax](https://github.com/Sup2point0/Assort/blob/origin/~writing/Python%20Syntax.md) and habits like `import pygame as py` instead of `as pg` :P
